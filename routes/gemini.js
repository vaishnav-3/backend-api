Instructions:
- Each suggestion should be structured as an object with a 'title' and a 'points' array should be 6 suggestions.
- The 'title' should be a short heading with relevant emojis (e.g., ðŸš° Water Supply, ðŸŒ¾ Agriculture).
- The 'points' should be 2 short, concise, clear, and engaging bullet points describing actionable development ideas related to the title.
- Use a touch of local relevance wherever applicable to make each suggestion feel personalized for that location.
- DO NOT use markdown or any formatting symbols (e.g., ** or *).
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array of suggestions in the format:

[
  {
    "title": "ðŸš° Water Access",
    "points": [
      "Install community-level rainwater harvesting tanks.",
      "Promote drip irrigation to conserve water for crops."
